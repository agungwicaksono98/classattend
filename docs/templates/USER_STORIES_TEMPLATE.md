# Global User Stories (Epics)

This document tracks the **High-Level Epics** of the product. Do NOT list fine-grained feature stories here (put those in `docs/features/[feature-name]/prd.md`).

## Core Epics

### 1. Authentication & Onboarding
- As a **New User**, I want to sign up efficiently so that I can access the platform services.
- As a **Registered User**, I want to recover my password securely so that I don't lose access.

### 2. Document Management
- As a **User**, I want to organize my files in folders so that I can retrieve them easily.
- As a **User**, I want to search across all my documents so that I find information without manual browsing.

### 3. AI Interaction
- As a **User**, I want to ask questions to my documents so that I get answers without reading full texts.
- As a **User**, I want to verify the AI's answer sources so that I can trust the information.

### 4. Admin & Settings
